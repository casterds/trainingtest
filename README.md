Blocker :

There was issue when running the etherspot library even with there give getting-started examples. Looking and debugging at it.

Below is description of the issue


```ERROR in ./node_modules/@etherspot/eip1271-verification-util/dist/esm/index.js 3:0-19
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'os' in '/Users/testproject/txkit-quickstart/node_modules/@etherspot/eip1271-verification-util/dist/esm'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.```
